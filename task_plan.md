# ChronoHybridMem implementation plan

## Goal

Deliver the v0.1.0 Docker-ready evidence retrieval baseline described in `docs/SPEC.md`.

- [x] Create independent local Git repository and approved implementation specification.
- [x] Implement schemas, SQLite persistence and FTS retrieval.
- [x] Implement FastAPI routes and configuration.
- [x] Add contract, isolation and idempotency tests.
- [ ] Add Docker packaging, README and verify the full build/test path (packaging complete; verification blocked locally).

## Errors encountered

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|---|---:|---|
| Python dependency installation timed out; initial virtualenv pip was corrupted | 2 | Used static compilation for this session; Docker/pytest verification remains pending in an environment with working package access. |
| Docker CLI unavailable | 1 | Dockerfile is complete; image build must run on a machine with Docker installed. |
